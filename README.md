# test-your-code-knowledge
## About this project
I was tasked with creating a quiz to test an individual's knowledge on javascript. 
I started by creating the dom, or the "bones" html. I then added in the neccesary javascript to make the quiz function. In JS, I added some reusable function so I would not have to do the same thing over and over. I also used nifty js helpers, like the spread operator, so that I could make the code cleaner. All of my code is commented out in detail. 

Below, you can find the link to my live site, and screen shots of the site.
